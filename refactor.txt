The three working cards that were refactored are "remodel", "cutpurse", and "sea hag". the process of refactoring was relatively straightforward: build a function with the same code used in the switch statement case for that card, with parameters according to what is needed in the card's code. The other two refactored cards are "council room" and "outpost". these cards have one or two lines commented out in order to screw up their behavior as per assignment 1's requirements. otherwise the process of refactoring for these two cards did not change compared to the other three.
